                        <h5 class="range">(also see project brainstorm from week 1) I chose this idea as my final project because I am thinking of becoming an elementary school teacher after college and wanted to create something that was at least semi-related to early education. I also wanted to make something that would be relatively small and compact (just for the aesthetic). Thus, creating a math box game to teach very simple addition and subtraction seemed like a good fit. It was an added plus that I also got to incorporate my toast project from earlier in the semester because yes I am still obsessed with toast :D</h5>

                        <h3>Week 11: Project Iteration</h3>
                        <h5 class="range">For this assignment, my main goal was to make a new tile slot and tile to fit in the slot that would fit well enough that the arduino could accurately read the voltage divider inside of the tile. The original tile slot that I created would not quite fit the tile pieces when the flat head screws were fully screwed into the number tile, so the first thing that I did was re-design this part to fit better. However, I had not worked on this project in a while, AND I had not done a good job with making the Fusion design easy to change (everything was parameterized but when I would change the parameter values, some parts wouldn't line up anymore and it got super messy), so I ended up fully redoing the outerbox design in Fusion, which of course took a while (although definitely less time than last time). I made the screw tracks on the outerbox a bit wider and less thick to better fit the screws since the screws go deeper into the tile side holes than I had originally anticipated. I also shifted the hole on the bottom of the number tile to the bottom right corner instead of in the middle of the bottom surface to create some more space and make assembly of each tile easier. Once I got these parts printed, I inserted the pieces of metal that I had from my MVP and again used tape to connect wires to the metal. I put the number 1 voltage divider into the new tile box, and tested these out together.</h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><img src="wk11media/newTile.jpg" alt="new tile and tile slot" id="headshot"></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">The test actually seemed to work pretty well, as long as the wires kept contact with the pieces of metal. Thus, I decided to print out two more of the outerbox pieces and nine more of the number tiles with lids for the rest of the digits 0-9 (STL files in the tab on the left...). A few of the prints were too wobbly so I had to reprint those ones since the fit of the tile into the tile slot has to be pretty uniform in order for everything to work. After the first round of printing, I assembled the rest of the tiles numbered 1-4 using three flat head screws for each tile (one on the top side surface, one on the left side surface, and one on the bottom surface).</h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><img src="wk11media/tiles1-4.jpg" alt="new tiles 1-4" id="headshot"></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">Once the rest of the prints finished, I assembled the rest of the tiles (definitely got better at it as I went, since it was pretty slow-going at the beginning...). However, there weren't enough of the M5 flat head screws in the lab, so I ended up changing all of the bottom screws to M5 socket head screws, which have a slightly smaller head diameter and a slightly larger head depth. I decided that my arms were too weak at the moment to try to saw more pieces of metal for the two other tile slots, so I will do that in the very near future once I mentally prepare myself to kill my arm in a few days. I tested the tiles, though, to see if they would fit in the tile slot, and they did (for the most part--a couple were getting a little stuck but I think I just need to tighten the side screws). When I tested them with the Arduino, it still wasn't perfect and the readings were not always working, but I think this has to do with the taped wire connections and switching the the socket head screws, which changed the height of the tile when it is put into the slot, so I am just waiting for more of the flat head screws to ship here so I can switch them all back to the original configuration. Overall, I think I made some good progress from my MVP now that I have one tile per digit and multiple tile slots (minus the important metal parts) printed and have gotten over that 3D printing time obstacle. The next step will be cutting more metal and making more secure wire connections (and hopefully this will increase the accuracy of the arduino readings).</h5>

                        <h3>Weeks 13 & 14: The rest of it...</h3>
                        <h5 class="range">After making my week 11 project iteration, the next major thing to do was to create the actual container to house the tile slots. I wanted to make a box with holes for the slots on the top and then space for a small breadboard and an Arduino uno on the inside. After taking forever to saw the rest of the small metal pieces and then soldering wires to them (multiple times because I apparently did a bad job the first two times so the wires kept falling off…I ended up using some copper tape on top of the edge of the metal pieces because the solder was not sticking to the metal pieces themselves). I used Fusion to design the main box for the project. I decided to make the lid of the box out of two layers of wood. The top layer has four holes cut out for the slots and an equal sign to indicate the direction of the box. The bottom layer is a slightly smaller rectangle that the tile slots can rest on. The bottom of the box is made of five pieces of wood fitted together with tabs. After laser cutting all of these pieces out, I used a pencil to mark where the different holes of the tile slots would be on the bottom layer of the main box lid so that I could drill holes in this layer for the slot wires to go into the box (3 holes for each slot for the power, ground, and pin wires). After drilling all of the holes, I used wood glue to stick the two layers of the lid together and left that overnight to dry/cure. I also used wood glue to stick all but one of the walls of the bottom of the main box together so that I could still easily access the inside of the box (the lid can be removed, but it is easier to connect wires through the side of the box rather than the top). I also used hot glue (per Bobby’s suggestion/approval) to glue the pin wire metal pieces to the main box lid. </h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><img src="finalmedia/boxPieces.jpg" alt="lasercut outer box" id="smalljpg"><img src="finalmedia/boxGlueDrying.jpg" alt="wood gluing the bottom of the box with three walls" id="smalljpg"><img src="finalmedia/hotGlueBoxLid.jpg" alt="hot glue for bottom metal pieces to box lid" id="smalljpg"></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">While the glue for the bottom of the box was drying, I started connecting all of the wires to the breadboard/Arduino with the tile slots inserted in the lid of the main box. One problem that I ran into, though, was that the metal pieces that I had hot glued were not completely flat because the soldering was not flat which made the connections between the number tiles and the pin wire metal a bit flakey. I also 3D printed out a plus sign and a minus sign tile to use for the second slot in the main box and had to put these two tiles together (screws, voltage divider, etc). I added an operator class to my code to accommodate these new tiles so that the plus sign (and tiles with digits 0-4) would be read as a "+" and the minus sign (and tiles with digits 5-9) would be read as a "-". I also added to the code so that you could see what numbers and which operator were being read on the serial monitor.</h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><img src="finalmedia/operatorTilesOpen.jpg" alt="plus and minus sign tiles" id="smalljpg"><img src="finalmedia/setupNoBox.jpg" alt="circuitry without bottom of box" id="smalljpg"></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">The wires were much more stiff than I thought they would be, so even without the bottom of the box, the lid could sit/float over the arduino and breadboard. Once I wired everything up, I tested out a few tiles and the serial monitor was printing the correct numbers (as long as you held down the tile in the third slot...)</h5>

                        <h5 class="range">Once the bottom of the main box was dry, I tried putting everything together. This was a bit tricky because the wires were so stiff and were a bit longer than necessary to reach the breadboard and arduino inside of the box, but after trimming some of the wires and bending some of the wires, I got everything to stay put. I also realized that I had not thought of a way to allow the cord connecting the arduino to my computer to go through the box, so I ended up lasercutting a hole in the remaining main box wall that I had not glued to everything else so that one end of the arduino could stick out and be plugged into my laptop. This hole was also useful because I decided that my output for my box would be my happy/sad toast from week 4, and the servo wires could also fit through the lasercut hole. I then had to do some combining of code for reading the number tiles with my servo code from week 4 so that the servo would rotate based on whether the equation created by the tiles was true or false. I had to experiment with the timing of checking the number values and other things because the code was sampling at too high a rate and the motor was just constantly moving around, but once I found a good amount of time between samples, the box seemed to be working pretty well! I also 3D printed a new stick for the toast to connect to the servo, since the wooden stick from week 4 was a bit too thin.</h5>

                        <h5 class="range">Unfortunately, the third tile slot was still not very reliable. I tried using double sided tape (again per Bobby's suggestion) to secure the tile slots in the box lid in a more stable position, but I couldn't get the position for the third slot quite right. I spent quite a while trying different amounts of tilting in each direction, but that spot is still probably the weakest part of the project (works for a bit and then stops working and then starts working again etc... as you can see in the video, it requires pressure in a very specific place to get a more constant, correct reading).</h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><video id="headshot" controls autoplay muted><source src="finalmedia/finalTest1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">After working for a while on the third tile slot, I decided to finally move on and close up each of the tiles using tiny M1.4 screws. This also took much longer than I anticipated because the screws are so tiny and are very difficult to get into the 3D prints, but I eventually got them all closed up!</h5>
                        <h5 class="range" style="text-align:center"><img src="finalmedia/tinyScrews.jpg" alt="tiles closed with small screws" id="smalljpg"></h5>
                        <h5 class="range">Yay!! I am very happy with how it all turned out. Definitely learned a lot and had a TON of fun with everything :) I do wish I could've gotten the project to work a bit more consistently, but I think it actually works a lot better than I expected it to. I am also happy that I got to make something that is related to early education, since that is the field that I am interested in going into after college!</h5>
